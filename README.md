# QDED
Quadrature Disambiguation Edge Detection 

This code was converted to Linux Environment with some changes to allow the generation of filter values from PGM files.

How to use:
1. Put PGM files in images folder
2. Compile with gcc *.c -lm
3. Run executable

IMPORTANT: Read the note in features.c. This code assumes that all images input will share the same dimension sizes.
