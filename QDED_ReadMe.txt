 Quadrature Disambiguation Edge Detection (QDED)

Quadrature Disambiguation is a non-pixel based edge detector.  It is modeled on the processing of the retina and visual cortex. The image is covered by a grid of small circles (receptive fields).  Assume that each receptive field contains exactly one edge. The algorithm gives the position of the edge, its angle, and the relative contrast between the two sides. It can also evaluate the validity of the edge-only hypothesis, and find secondary features. It does so by convolving the visual image in the receptive field with a kernel, and replacing the information in the receptive field by three to five numbers.

The original version is described in Folsom & Pinter, "Quadrature Disambiguation by Steering, Quadrature and Scale", IEEE Transactions on  Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Nov 1998, pp. 1161-1173.  QDED was inspired by Nobel Prize winning work by Hubel and Wiesel. They described receptive fields in cat visual cortex, some responding to edges and some responding to bars. The eye discards the original pixel representation before compressing and transmitting a different representation to the brain; all mammalian visual processing appears to be based on convolutions with a few primitive kernels. Folsom's algorithm demonstrates how computationally useful information can be extracted from this encoding.

The theory of steerable filters says that you can sample a convolved image with kernels at 2, 3, or 4 angles (depending on the order of the filter), and then compute how the image would respond to convolution with a kernel at any angle. QDED convolves the image with a small number of filters, computes the derivative, and sets it to zero. The resulting equations are solved to find the angle that maximizes response, and then steers odd and even convolved receptive fields to that angle. The odd and even filter are in quadrature phase. Their phase gives the position of the edge, and their magnitude gives the contrast.

The published work used seven filters: three third order and four fourth order. A second set of seven filters at double the diameter detected bar widths. Thus each patch of image needed to be processed by 14 filters. Even with 14 filters, the QDED algorithm is time-competitive with a Canny edge detector followed by a Hough transform.

What Hubel and Wiesel described as a bar detector may really be the quadrature phase of an edge detector. Thus there is no need for the second filter size. A second order filter works at least as well as a fourth order. Thus five filters (two even and three odd) per receptive field suffice for QDED.

The version posted here was designed for range estimation from stereo. [T. C. Folsom,  “Non-pixel Robot Stereo”, IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Image and Signal Processing, April 2, 2007, Honolulu, HI, pp 7 -12.]  The only concern is vertical edges, so the algorithm does not need to steer the filters to an arbitrary angle. This version was designed to run on a DSP.

QDED can be used with any arrangement of receptive fields. For instance, if one wants to detect vehicles or other objects on a road, a uniform grid could be used on the first pass to identify the road edges. A second pass could use smaller diameter receptive fields at the road edge, and medium diameter fields within the region of interest defined by the road. The size and number of receptive fields can be varied according to the processing available. The algorithm supports the non-uniform sampling of the eye-brain system, with saccades used to focus high acuity on areas of interest.

There is a fundamental difference between QDED and other edge detectors. Most edge detectors take an image in and produce output as an image edge/no edge at each pixel. To find equations describing lines, one must then do additional processing, for instance with a Hough Transform. QDED output is not an image; it is numbers describing the slope and intercept of the line in each receptive field.
